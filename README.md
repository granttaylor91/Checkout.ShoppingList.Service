# Checkout.ShoppingList.Service


This project is shopping list to manage drink orders for an office.

The solution was created in Visual Studio 2017 and .Net Core 1.1 Web API.

It's a very basic implementation that handles simple CRUD operations.

The API is Documented by Swagger and this, as well as interactive calls via the browser can be found at the swagger endpoint:
http://localhost:[port]/swagger 

You'll probably notice there isn't really anything special or complex in there. I could talk for hours about things I would have liked to put in the project, however in the end I ran out of time.
